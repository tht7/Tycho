BarTab -- or -- Drink now, pay later: put your tabs on your bar tab!
====================================================================

So you keep open tabs like libraries keep books... Aren't you afraid
Pale Moon will consume all your memory?  Don't you fear browser restarts
because it takes so long to reload all your tabs?

Well, you shouldn't! Because now you can put all the tabs you don't
need on your bar tab, and only pay for the load when you actually want
to visit them.

BarTab can intercept when tabs are loaded in the background or
restored after a browser restart and will only load the content when
the tab is actually visited.  It also allows you to free memory by
unloading already loaded tabs, either manually or automatically.
