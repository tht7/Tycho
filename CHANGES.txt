5.0
----------------
New year new me!

* Added the ability to whitelist a specific URL

* Added the ability to be installed on WaterFox (classic)!

4.0
----------------

* Adopt project, with new name "BarTab Tycho", explicitly targeting Pale Moon

* Allow pinned tabs to be unloaded again

3.2
----------------

* Support for "select nearest loaded tab" when using tab groups.

* Drop support for SeaMonkey for the time being. SeaMonkey doesn't
  support tab groups, so the "select nearest loaded tab" code that
  works with tab groups won't work on SeaMonkey. I hope to restore
  support later on, but for the time being, Firefox is the priority.

* A new option to let "unload other tabs" only affect tabs in the
  current tab group.

2.1 (unreleased)
----------------

* Support for Firefox 4.0 and SeaMonkey.

* Fixed a compatibility issue with Tree Style Tab: When the last child
  tab is unloaded, the tab was wrongly detached from the tree.  Thanks
  to SHIMODA Hiroshi for the patch.


2.0 (2010-05-24)
----------------

* Instead of a series of brittle patches, BarTab now only uses a
  single plug point -- the nsIWebNavigation object -- to hook itself
  into the tabbrowser.  This improves maintainability and
  compatibility with other add-ons.

  Note: Due to differences in the event setup, not loading background
  tabs is no longer supported when using Firefox 3.5.  However, BarTab
  still allows you to not load restored tabs as well as to manually
  and automatically unload tabs.

* Unloaded tabs now report the right URI to other components.  That
  means unloaded tabs can now be bookmarked and add-ons such as Tab
  Popup report the right URI for them.

* Tabs that were opened in the background but never loaded are now
  properly restored after a restart.

* If configured to prevent background tabs from loading, BarTab now
  also intercepts background tabs that are opened by clicking a link
  when the 'browser.tabs.loadDivertedInBackground' prefence is
  enabled.

* Queries to the nsINavHistoryService and nsIFaviconService are now
  performed asynchronously when restoring tabs.  While this may cause
  small delays in the display of tab titles and icons, it makes the UI
  more responsive directly after the browser start.

* XPCOM services are now acquired lazily and cached.

* If enabled, switching to the nearest loaded tab now prefers tabs on
  the right hand side given equally distant tabs.  This matches
  Firefox's default behaviour of closing tabs to the right.

* The preference window is now more forgiving when entering host names
  of sites that should always be loaded.  The list now also allows
  multiple hosts to be selected for removal.

* Improved tab context menu item behaviour.

* Improved compatibility with Firefox 3.7a5 (Bug 554991).

* The extension packaging has been slimmed down and compressed to
  reduce file IO.


1.5.1 (2010-04-07)
------------------

* Fixed a missing string in the German translation.


1.5 (2010-04-05)
----------------

* One may now specify whether BarTab should load an unloaded tab upon
  switching to it immediately or after a given delay, or whether to
  ask the user if the tab should be loaded.

* Jumping to the nearest loaded tab when closing a tab can now be
  turned off.

* Improved the way BarTab finds the loaded tab nearest to a given tab.


1.4.2 (2010-03-21)
------------------

* Bugfix: When closing a tab, BarTab will now only jump to the nearest
  loaded tab when the tab that's being closed is the active one.


1.4.1 (2010-03-21)
------------------

* Updated Spanish translation.  Thanks to Danny Navarro.


1.4 (2010-03-21)
----------------

* One may now specify sites that should always be loaded and never be
  unloaded using a context menu command.

* Firefox doesn't always store the correct history information for
  URIs containing anchor references (Bug 420605).  BarTab now works
  around that and tries to find the correct favicon.

* The user interface for BarTab no longer mentions putting things on
  the bar tab.  It's a confusing metaphor, especially when it comes to
  translations.  Instead it talks about loading and unloading tabs.

* When closing a tab, BarTab now tries to find the nearest loaded tab
  to activate, instead of forcing one of the neighbouring tabs to
  load.

* Improved compatibility with Firefox 3.7a4 (Bug 347930).  Thanks to
  Paul O'Shannessy for pointing out the source of the problem.  Note:
  this doesn't mean that 3.7a4 is officially supported.

* Added Russian translation.  Thanks to Style Thing.

* Added Spanish translation.  Thanks to Felipe Barousse Boué and Danny
  Navarro.


1.3.2 (2010-03-04)
------------------

* Updated Japanese translation.  Thanks to drry.


1.3.1 (2010-03-02)
------------------

* Added French translation.  Thanks to Pierre Buard.


1.3 (2010-02-28)
----------------

* Already loaded tabs can now be unloaded again ("put on the bar tab").
  One may do so manually using a context menu command.  There is also
  an optional automatic timer that will trigger after a certain amount
  of time specified by the user.

* Improved compatibility with the Tab Mix Plus extension.  Tab Mix
  Plus reuses blank tabs when opening tabs from e.g. bookmarks, and it
  confuses tabs on the bar tab with blank ones.  BarTab now makes sure
  that this no longer happens.

* New coaster logo, thanks to Róman Joost.


1.2.2 (2010-02-18)
------------------

* Completed and enabled Polish translation.


1.2.1 (2010-02-18)
------------------

* To comply with Mozilla's Add-on guidelines, BarTab preferences are
  no longer available from the Firefox preference dialog.  You'll now
  find them in the extension manager.

* Added Polish translation.  Thanks to Grzglo Tech Blog.


1.2 (2010-02-14)
----------------

* Rename BarTap to BarTab.  Due to an instance of spontaneous dyslexia
  on my part, I confused 'tab' with 'tap'.  Of course I meant 'bar tab',
  not the 'tap' that beer comes out of.

* Fix faulty behaviour with about: and chrome:// URLs

* The "Reload Tab" and "Reload All Tabs" context menu items now work
  as expected.  For tabs that are on your bar tab, they will cause the
  tab contents to be loaded.  For all other tabs they will perform a
  reload as usual.

* Fix faulty behaviour when tabs are opened in the background don't
  have a referrer, e.g. when you open bookmarks in the background.

* Improve compatibility with the Split Brower add-on.

* Improve conformity with Mozilla add-on guidelines by reducing the
  usage of eval().

* Added coaster logo.


1.1 (2010-02-04)
----------------

* No longer install a custom tabbrowser binding.  This reduces code
  duplication to zero and improves compatibility with other
  extensions.  Much thanks to SHIMODA Hiroshi for the patch.

* Use the 'SSTabRestoring' event from the nsISessionStore service to
  hijack restored tabs.  This should improve compatibility with other
  extensions that use tabbrowser.addTab().  Thanks to Masahal for the
  suggestions.

* Moved preferences out of the horrible Add-on Manager UI and into
  Firefox's Tab preference pane.


1.0.1 (2010-01-31)
------------------

* Added Japanese translation.  Thanks to drry.

* Added German translation.


1.0 (2010-01-29)
----------------

Initial release.
